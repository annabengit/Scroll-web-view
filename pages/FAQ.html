              <p>
                All scooters are checked before leaving the warehouse, however,
                there are cases when certain defects are encountered due to
                improper use. If you notice that the scooter is faulty, please
                report it and our operating team can correct the defect.

              Why does the speed of the scooter decrease?

            <div class="content answer">
              <p>
                In order to move safely, there are zones in the application
                where the speed of the scooter is limited, for example: in
                crowded places such as parks and squares you can not scroll at
                high speed, because it can endanger others and you. This is why,
                when entering such areas, for your own safety and the safety of
                others, the scrolling speed decreases.
